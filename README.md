# discordjsv14-bot-downloader
A go program that downloads a basic discord.js v14 bot to my current working directory, then installs the dependencies needed.

This is for personal use but can easily be customized to your needs by doing the following:

1. Fork this repo (star it aswell)
3. Use `make` to add the program to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, **or**  `make binary` and add it to your `$PATH` manually.
4. Run `djs-bot-download` in your project directory to bot template.
